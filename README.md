# lua-general
Self created library for lua to make it easier to use.  
Actually, more like a lua improved library.  
I don't know.

---------------------

There's a trick I just knew. You can set the environment variable _LUA_INIT_ to a path to the lua script you want to automatic run while lua interpreter setup.  
I found it pretty useful, as that I personally use lua more as an advance calculator which runs in terminal instead of really coding using it. But even if you are using it to code, it won't hurt to init it.  
Here's an example code provided by GPT-4:

> export LUA_INIT="@/path/to/your/startup.lua"

Actually, GPT is pretty useful. I used to think that it's not accurate enough, but recently my altitude has changed rapidly.  
Also, that '@' is mandatory, put it in front of root ('/').
